# econnect

Received a brief from Marketing and Communication that required a solution for dynamic columns occurring in eConnect flat files. 

The purpose of eConnect is to provide a sophisticated email marketing solution for TNA. It essentially serves around 300,000 subscribers to whom millions of marketing emails per year are sent by TNA. The Marketing and Communications team use eConnect to download customer datasets and Business Systems Support use it to transform and load into a Single Customer View amalgamated with other sources to provide customer insight. 

eConnect is proprietary external software browser-based platform provided by subcontractor www.ukchanges.com, which is licensed and not physically on premises. This means the internal software cannot be changed by third-parties under regulation or policy.
